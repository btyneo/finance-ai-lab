# Finance AI Lab ðŸš€

![Quant Banner](images/quant.jpeg)

This repository documents my **180-day journey into Finance + AI**.  
The goal: build skills in quantitative finance, econometrics, and machine learning â€” while shipping projects that demonstrate real-world applications.

---

## ðŸ“Œ About
- Each notebook corresponds to a **task or project** (from my self-designed 6-month syllabus).  
- Tasks cover: pulling market data, financial analysis, time-series forecasting, risk modeling, trading strategies, and productization with ML/DL.  
- By the end, this repo will contain multiple finance AI projects and a deployable dashboard MVP.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Task 1 â€” SMA/EMA + Returns (PLTR Example)
- Pulled 1 year of PLTR stock data with `yfinance`.  
- Calculated 30-day **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** and **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**.  
- Computed daily returns (`pct_change`).  
- Visualized trends with `matplotlib`.  
- **Key insight:** EMA reacts faster to price movements, while SMA smooths long-term trends.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, yfinance)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experiments + documentation  
- Later: Streamlit for dashboards, ML/DL models for forecasting  

---

## ðŸš€ Roadmap (next tasks)
- Task 2: Financial statements & ratios (P/E, ROE, debt ratio)  
- Task 3â€“30: Time-series foundations (ARIMA, CAPM regression)  
- Task 61+: Volatility modeling (ARCH/GARCH, VaR)  
- Task 121+: Machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, walk-forward validation)  
- Task 151+: Deep learning (LSTM) + **Finance AI Dashboard MVP**  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Goal
By the end of this journey, this repo will demonstrate:
- Fundamental + quantitative finance knowledge  
- Time-series & econometric modeling  
- Machine learning & deep learning for finance  
- Deployable finance AI applications (Streamlit dashboard)
